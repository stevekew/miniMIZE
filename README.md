# miniMIZE

miniMIZE is a small desktop enhancing application that catches windows that you minimize and puts a thumbnail of the main application window on your desktop.

It is a clone of an application called MINt, started by Kapsules developer Andrew Powell.
Unfortunately MINt was discontinued and so I began work on miniMIZE.
The internal development name was chosen as Deskcon.

miniMIZE is now licenesed under the MIT license
